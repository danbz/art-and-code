In this video, via the BBC, Brian Eno discusses some of the techniques behind his music and demonstrates his current setup for creating and ‘tuning’ systems for creating ambient soundscapes.

While the video focuses primarily on the aleatory processes Eno uses, attentive viewers will note that Eno emphasizes his process of listening and refining his compositional rules to meet his aesthetic goals.
